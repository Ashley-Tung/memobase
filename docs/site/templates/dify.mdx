title: Dify Plugin for Long-Term Memory
---

Enhance your Dify applications with long-term memory by integrating the Memobase plugin. This guide will walk you through setting up and using the plugin to create more intelligent, context-aware AI agents.

## Prerequisites

First, find and install the open-source [Memobase plugin](https://github.com/ACAne0320/dify-plugin-memobase) from the Dify plugin marketplace.

Next, you'll need a Memobase instance:

-   **Memobase Cloud**: The easiest way to get started is by signing up for a managed instance on the [Memobase dashboard](https://www.memobase.io/en/dashboard).
-   **Self-Hosted**: For more control, you can deploy your own instance. See the [Memobase GitHub repository](https://github.com/memodb-io/memobase) for instructions.

## Plugin Configuration

To connect the plugin to your Memobase instance, you need to provide two credentials when adding the tool to your Dify application:

1.  **Memobase URL**: The API endpoint for your instance (e.g., `https://api.memobase.dev`).
2.  **Memobase API Key**: Your unique API key for authentication.

You can find both of these in your Memobase dashboard.

## Using the Plugin in Dify Workflows

Once configured, you can use the plugin's tools in your Dify workflows to:

-   **Store and Recall Conversations**: Persist dialogue for long-term context.
-   **Personalize Responses**: Retrieve user profiles to tailor interactions.
-   **Access Past Events**: Search and utilize historical user data.
-   **Manage Memory**: Directly manipulate data within your Memobase instance from Dify.

For detailed information on each tool, refer to the [Memobase API Reference](/api-reference/overview).

### Example Workflow

Here is a conceptual example of a Dify workflow that uses the Memobase plugin to retrieve and store memory:

By integrating Memobase, you can build sophisticated AI applications that learn from and remember past interactions, leading to more engaging and personalized user experiences.
