## Too many useless profile memories
1. Make sure you have the idea of what a profile should have.
2. [Configure](/features/profile/profile_desc) your `config.yaml` properly with profile slots' description.
3. If you still have too many useless profile memories, you can enable [strict mode](/features/profile/profile_config#strict-mode) 
to only collect the profiles you want.

## Some profiles should be extracted, but it's not.
1. Maybe your profile description is too hard for LLM to understand/infer, try to lower your requirements.
2. If you still have this issue, you can disable the [profile validation](/features/profile/profile_config#profile-validate-mode) 

## My profile is inaccurate/wrong.
1. Add more details to your [profile description](/features/profile/profile_desc), making sure the profile description is clear and easy to understand.
2. Add [update descrption](/features/profile/profile_desc#instruct-memobase-to-update-a-profile-slot) for that profile also, it will help Memobase to merge the profile wisely.
