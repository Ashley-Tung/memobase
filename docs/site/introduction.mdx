title: What is Memobase?
---

Is your AI's memory worse than a goldfish's? Memobase is the cure. 

It's a fast, scalable, long-term **user memory backend** for your AI, helping you build applications that actually remember who their users are.

We currently support these user memories from chats:
- [x] [Profile Memory](./features/profile/) - Who is the user?
- [x] [Event Memory](./features/event/) - What's happened in their life?
- [ ] Schedule Memory - What's on their calendar? (Coming soon!)
- [ ] Social Memory - Who do they know? (On the horizon!)

Memobase is under active development, and looking for brave early adopters to become our design partners!

## Vision
Our grand plan is to become the **second brain** for AI Applications, minus the existential dread.
