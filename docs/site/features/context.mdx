title: Personalized Context
---

Memobase may extract many kinds of memories from user, for example:
- User profile
- User events
- ...

And all of them are a part of the user's personalized context.

Memobase offers an API to get the personalized context of a user without packing those memories yourself:
```python
from memobase import MemobaseClient, ChatBlob

client = MemobaseClient(api_key="your_api_key")
uid = client.add_user()
u = client.get_user(uid)

u.insert(
    ChatBlob(
        messages=[{
                "role": "user",
                "content": "I'm Gus"
        }]
    )
)

print(u.context())
```
Detailed params is in [here](/api-reference/prompt/get_context).


## Search related events in Context
You can pass recent user chats to the context API to search related events, so the returned events in context will be more accurate, instead of latest events.

```python
u.context(chats=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's my name?"}
])
```
Detailed params is in [here](/api-reference/prompt/get_context#parameter-chats-str).
