title: Search Profile
---

In Memobase, we try to memorize user in a controllable, global [context](/features/context).
So that the `get` process is really fast and won't affect your latency.

But sometimes, you may want to search for something specific in the user's profile or context.

Memobase offers a search method for you to filter out the unrelated memories.
## Profile Search
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
p = u.profile(
    chats = [{"role": "user", "content": "Find some restaurants for me"}], 
    need_json=True
)

print(p)
```
```json Output
{
    "basic_info": {
        "allergies": "peanuts",
        "location": "San Francisco"
    },
    "interests": {
        "food": "user likes to eat pizza and sushi"
        ...
    } 
}
```
</CodeGroup>
[API Reference](/api-reference/profiles/profile#parameter-chats-str)

The profile search in Memobase is not a semantic-matching or keyword-matching, 
it heaily relies on the features of user, and using AI to rank what may be relevant.
For example, when user says "Find me a restaurant", Memobase does't just search for "restaurant", it thinks what aspects of user will help to answer this question, so:
- user has a profile `basic_info:location`, that will help to decide the location of the restaurant.
- user has a profile `interests:food`, that will help to decide the food type.
- user has a profile `basic_info:allergies`, that will help to decide what not to include.


In result, Memobase's profile search is much more helpful than a semantic search, and can help to answer the question.



### NOTICE
- profile search will increase your latency by 2-5 seconds (depends on the profile size). Use it wisely.
- profile search will cost your Memobase tokens, roughly 100~1000 tokens per chat based on the profile size.
