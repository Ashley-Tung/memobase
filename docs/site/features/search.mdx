title: Search Profile and Context
---

In Memobase, we try to memorize user in a controllable, global [context](/features/context).
So that the `get` process is really fast and won't affect your latency.

But sometimes, you may want to search for something specific in the user's profile or context.

Memobase offers a search method for you to filter out the unrelated memories.
## Profile Search
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
p = u.profile(
    chats = [{"role": "user", "content": "Find some restaurants for me"}], 
    need_json=True
)

print(p)
```
```json Output
{
    "basic_info": {
        "allergies": "peanuts",
        "location": "San Francisco"
    },
    "interests": {
        "food": "user likes to eat pizza and sushi"
        ...
    } 
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Context Search
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
c = u.context(chats = [{"role": "user", "content": "Find some restaurants for me"}])
print(c)
```
```txt Output
# Memory
Unless the user has relevant queries, do not actively mention those memories in the conversation.
## User Background:
- basic_info:allergies: peanuts
- basic_info:location: San Francisco
- interests:food: user likes to eat pizza and sushi
...

## Latest Events:
- User went to an Italian restaurant [mentioned on 2025-01-01]
- User went to a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown [mentioned on 2025-01-01]
...
```
</CodeGroup>

The search in Memobase is not a semantic-matching or keyword-matching, it heaily relies on the features of user, and using AI to rank what may be relevant.
For example, when user says "Find me a restaurant", Memobase does't just search for "restaurant", it thinks what aspects of user will help to answer this question, so:
- user has a profile `basic_info:location`, that will help to decide the location of the restaurant.
- user has a profile `interests:food`, that will help to decide the food type.
- user has a profile `basic_info:allergies`, that will help to decide what not to include.

And then Memobase will use those relevant profiles to search the possible user events to recall the details.

In result, Memobase's search is much more helpful than a semantic search, and can help to answer the question.
