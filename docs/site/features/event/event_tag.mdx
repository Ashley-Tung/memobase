title: Event Tag
---

Event tag is a way to tag anything attributes of event automatically.
You can use event tag to enrich the user event, and doing some tracking on the user sequential behavior, something like:
- emotion
- goal
- romance
- ...

## How to set event tag?
By default, Memobase will record no event tag. You need to set the event tag in your `config.yaml`:
```yaml config.yaml
event_tags:
  - name: "emotion"
    description: "Record the current emotion of user"
  - name: "romance"
    description: "Record anything about romance between user and assistant"
...
```
where `name` is the name of the event tag, and `description` is the description of the event tag.

Once you set the event tag, Memobase will record the event tag automatically and return events with event tags.
Check [here](/api-reference/events/get_events) for more details.

## Get event tags
You can get event tags from server by calling `get_event_tags` API.
```python
from memobase import MemoBaseClient

client = MemoBaseClient(project_url='PROJECT_URL', api_key='PROJECT_TOKEN')
u = client.get_user(uid)

events = u.event()
for event in events:
    print(event.event_data.event_tags)
```
