title: Searching Events
---

User events in Memobase are stored as a sequence of experiences, each enriched with [tags](/features/event/event_tag). By default, events are retrieved in chronological order, but Memobase also provides a powerful search function to find events based on a query.

## Semantic Search

You can perform a semantic search to find events related to a specific topic or concept.

```python
# To use the Python SDK, first install the package:
# pip install memobase

from memobase import MemoBaseClient

client = MemoBaseClient(project_url='YOUR_PROJECT_URL', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
user = client.get_user('some_user_id')

# Search for events related to the user's emotions
events = user.search_event("Anything about my emotions")
print(events)
```

This query will return events where the user discussed their emotions, events that were automatically [tagged](/features/event/event_tag) with an `emotion` tag, or events that updated profile slots related to emotion.

For a detailed list of search parameters, please refer to the [API documentation](/api-reference/events/search_events).
